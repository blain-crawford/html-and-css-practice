            <p class="bio"> Blain Robert Crawford was born in Noblesville, IN and raised in the small town of Tipton.  Showing an interest in and ear for music and poetry at a young age, Blain began to flourish artistically and creatively early in his life.  He found his true voice in the bass guitar when he was 13.  A new love and passion for interacting with music grew from working this new instrument. Blain began to perform in bands all around Indiana. By the age of 17, he had won numerous statewide ‘Battle of the Bands’ competitions and opened for such acts as Staind, Nickelback, and Chris Daughtry.

            At 18, Blain and his band The Post Script booked and executed their first independent tour.  The Post Script would go on to play hundreds of shows each year all across the United States, including two performances at The National Shrimp Festival in Gulf Shores, AL, an event that draws nearly two hundred thousand people yearly. 
            <br><br>
            “In and Out of Love,” the single from their first album, “Seasons Change” played on the number 1 Pop Radio Station in Indiana, Radio Now 100.9.  Through the relationships Blain built while writing, booking, and performing for the Post Script, he would go on to share the stage with bands such as The Plain White T’s, and Company of Thieves. He would later continue to work with Radio Now 100.9 in the writing of the station’s official Colts theme song and perform at several events for the station around Indiana.  
            <br><br>
            Following his years with The Post Script, Blain went on to play with the band The Waldemere Revival.  During these years, his abilities as a booking agent and promoter, as well as songwriter, and producer flourished.  During Blain’s first year with the band, The Waldemere Revival performed at many festivals and venues all across the nation- playing nearly 200 shows in all.  With this band Blain performed with countless artists in the Jam and Bluegrass scene of the Midwest and South. 
            <br><br>
            After his time with The Waldemere Revival, Blain continued playing in Indiana and the surrounding areas with many popular local artists such as The Max Allen Band and Brooke Row. He also performed weekly at local venues around Indiana before earning a scholarship to Berklee College of Music in 2012.
            <br><br>
            While at Berklee, Blain not only worked toward a dual focus in Music Production, and Engineering, and, Bass performance, but, he also managed to book for, travel, perform, and record in a variety of bands. His playing fit seamlessly into a diverse cross section of music genres in the Boston music scene.  Noteworthy acts he has played with include Amy and the Engine, The George Woods Band, Heather Woods, Kill Madonna, The Sam Hammerman Collective, The Boston Philharmonic Funk Foundation, Perfect Mark, Luke Niccoli, and many more.
            <br><br>
            Currently Blain lives in the Boston Metro Area.  He can be found performing with his band Miss Fairchild and with many other local acts, or doing session work at one of the many studios in the area. He continues to work on booking, holding music festivals and charity events in the Boston area, as well as, writing and producing for himself, and other artists.<p>
